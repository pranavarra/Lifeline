# Lifeline
Lifeline is smart band system that creates a better connection between the patients and the doctors.

The lifeline smart band has sensors such as a heart rate monitor, oxygen monitor and temperature monitor(further upgrades can be done). These sesnors detect a patient's vitals and alerts the doctor in critical situations through a mobile application.

The lifeline repository comprises of three branches:

1. Application Branch: This branch consists of the lifeline application written in java.
2. Arduino Branch: This branch deals with all the sensors connected to a microcontroller to transmit the patient's data.
3. Backend Branch: The backend branch deals with the database and hosting service. This creates a connection between the microcontroller, database and the application.
